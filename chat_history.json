You want to create a mobile app called \"myID\" that integrates with the phone's voicemail, offering webhook options. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Voicemail Access:** The app should be able to access and display voicemails from the user's phone.\n*   **Webhook Integration:** Implement settings to allow users to configure webhooks that trigger on new voicemail events.\n*   **Basic UI:** A simple and intuitive user interface to manage voicemails and webhook settings.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#6200ee` (Deep purple)\n    *   Secondary: `#03dac6` (Teal)\n    *   Accent: `#bb86fc` (Light purple)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#ff4081` (Pink)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** No changes needed here, assuming the project is already set up with React Native and Expo.\n2.  **UI Structure:**\n    *   Create a `Settings` screen in the `app/(tabs)` directory to manage webhook configurations.\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to display the list of voicemails.\n3.  **Voicemail Access:**\n    *   Research Expo libraries or native modules for accessing voicemail data. This might require custom native code.\n4.  **Webhook Implementation:**\n    *   Implement the webhook functionality in the `Settings` screen. This will involve creating a form for users to enter the webhook URL and event triggers.\n5.  **Integrate Settings:**\n    *   Make sure the settings are saved and loaded correctly.\n\n**Implementation Instructions for the Coding Agent:**\n\n1.  Create a new file `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` for the settings screen.\n2.  Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to display a placeholder list of voicemails.\n3.  Implement a basic form in `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` for webhook URL configuration.\n4.  Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n5.  Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include the new `settings` tab.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-20T00:35:39.148240"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the \"myID\" app with voicemail integration and webhook options.
